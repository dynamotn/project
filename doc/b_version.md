This will print a representation the version of Projekt.
The output will look something like this:

- Version is the semantic version of the release.
- GitCommit is the SHA for the commit that this version was built from.
- GitTreeState is "clean" if there are no local code changes when this binary was
  built, and "dirty" if the binary was built from locally modified code.
- GoVersion is the version of Go that was used to compile Projekt.

When using the --template flag the following properties are available to use in
the template:

- .Version contains the semantic version of Helm
- .GitCommit is the git commit
- .GitTreeState is the state of the git tree when Helm was built
- .GoVersion contains the version of Go that Helm was compiled with

For example, --template='Version: {{.Version}}' outputs 'Version: vx.x.x'.
